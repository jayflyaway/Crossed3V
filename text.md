The Crossed 3 is another pattern of the crossed V-Variations.
Like the Crossed V (link), it is based on a crossed walkway, where the juggler walking over to change the feeder now walks through the pattern to the other side, instead of around the outside.

Characteristically for all Crossed V Variation pattern is that the hands are flipped after every transition. 
Passes are thrown from the left hand, and the manipulator is left-handed, too. 

To switch between the hands, there is an extra self at the end of each transition. The feeder does one 3-count, the feedies do one 5-count. We found that counting out loudly helped: “1 —- 2 —- 3 self self”

While it is quite hard to juggle during the transition when walking through the pattern, 
the Crossed 3 come with a charming "attribute"
The normally walking B is intercepted by the Manipulator. Which causes that the  
walk through the pattern is replaced by the manipulation.
